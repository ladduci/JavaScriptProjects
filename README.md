# JavaScriptProjects

## A portfolio of JavaScript Projects.

Learning JavaScript. I'll track my projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

### FizzBuzz
I start with a simple FizzBuzz implementation: the program prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three 
it prints “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it print “FizzBuzz".

### Comment App

A simple web app that allows a user to input comments.
